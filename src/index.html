        <h2>Great American Tour</h2>
        <p>
            <b>The World's Longest Tricycle Race</b> starts in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska and follows the path of the Pan-American Highway to Ushuaia, Argentina. Initially, up to 7 competitors start the race, chasing the $500 Million prize at the end.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>History</b> No one has ever completed the course. During the first running of the race in 2011, the last of 4 competitors quit due to injuries sustained in a fall near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. In the second running of the race in 2015,
            thanks to stronger competitors, better tricycles, and a summer start, the competition ended near Albuquerque when the final competitor was tragically lost in a flash flood. The most recent race in 2019 ended when the final 2 competitors disappeared
            in the Darien Gap in Panama. Unfortunately, the footage of what was presumably their final days was not uploaded successfully, and they have never been located.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Last Monday,</b> the participants had their last bit of rest at the Aurora Hotel. Padding around in their slippers, everyone from the grizzled mountain man Denver, to the 22-year-old BMX champ Dana, sipped espressos (the hotel and the city
            are alcohol-free) and chatted excitedly.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Tuesday</b> dawned crisp and cool. Even in the summer, temperature stay close to freezing and today was no exception with 37 degrees at 9 AM. Denver, Dana, Hai, and Erik were dressed in layers and prepared to tackle the Alaskan wilderness
            with only what they can carry on their tricycles.

                        <b>Dana Baker</b> had been training hard in the rockies for the past 2 years. The first 30 miles of the flat boring wasteland zoomed as if it wasn't even there. She took a short break, drinking a Gatorade and eating a sandwich
                        before anyone else caught up with her. Back on the road, she continued to increase her lead as she started up the incline. Precisely at the 60 mile mark, she stopped and set up her small tent, built a small fire and made some supper.

                        <b>Denver Matthews</b> took a pace more fitting for a 19,000 mile race. Depending on his survival skills to give him the edge, he set off at a leisurely pace. Figuring he could complete the course in under 2 years if he managed
                        around 30 miles per day, he lagged the other riders. He kept to his pace for 3 weeks,

        This site is something I hacked together in a weekend. That explains it, right? If I'd spent longer it might be good, but who has that kind of time.
