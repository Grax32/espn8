            <b>The World's Longest Tricycle Race</b> starts in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska and follows the path of the Pan-American Highway to Ushuaia, Argentina. Initially, 7 competitors start the race, chasing the $500 Million prize at the end. No one has ever
            completed the course, with last year's competitors being the most successful; the final 2 disappearing in the Darien Gap near Panama.
