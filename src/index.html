        <h2>Great American Tour</h2>
        <p>
            <b>The World's Longest Tricycle Race</b> starts in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska and follows the path of the Pan-American Highway to Ushuaia, Argentina. Initially, 7 competitors start the race, chasing the $500 Million prize at the end.

            <b>History</b> No one has ever completed the course. During the first running of the race in 2011, the last of 4 competitors quit due to injuries sustained in a fall near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. In the second running of the race in 2015,
            thanks to stronger competitors, better tricycles, and a summer start, the competition ended near Albuquerque when the final competitor was tragically lost in a flash flood. The most recent race in 2019 ended when the final 2 competitors disappeared
            in the Darien Gap in Panama. Unfortunately, the footage of what was presumably their final days was not uploaded successfully, and they have never been located.

            <b>Last Monday,</b> the participants had their last bit of rest at the Aurora Hotel. Padding around in their slippers, everyone from the grizzled mountain man Denver, to the 22-year-old BMX champ Dana, sipped espressos (the hotel and the city
            are alcohol-free) and chatted excitedly.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Tuesday</b> dawned crisp and cool. Even in the summer, temperature stay close to freezing and today was no exception with 37 degrees at 9 AM. Denver, Dana, Hai, and Erik were dressed in layers and prepared to tackle the Alaskan wilderness
            with only what they can carry on their tricycles.

        This site is something I hacked together in a weekend. That explains it, right? If I'd spent longer it might be good, but who has that kind of time.
