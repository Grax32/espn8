        <h2>Great American Tour</h2>
        <p>
            <b>The World's Longest Tricycle Race</b> starts in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska and follows the path of the Pan-American Highway to Ushuaia, Argentina. Initially, 7 competitors start the race, chasing the $500 Million prize at the end.

            <b>History</b> No one has ever completed the course. During the first running of the race in 2011, the last of 4 competitors quit due to injuries sustained in a fall near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. In the second running of the race in 2015,
            thanks to stronger competitors, better tricycles, and a summer start, the competition ended near Albuquerque when the final competitor was tragically lost in a flash flood. The most recent race in 2019 ended when the final 2 competitors disappeared
            in the Darien Gap in Panama. Unfortunately, the footage of what was presumably their final days was not uploaded successfully, and they have never been located.

        This site is something I hacked together in a weekend. That explains it, right? If I'd spent longer it might be good, but who has that kind of time.
